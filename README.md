1. Understanding the Dataset
    What is the size of the dataset (rows and columns)?
    What are the data types of the features (categorical, numerical, date)?
    Are there any missing values, and how much of the data is missing?
    Are there outliers that may represent errors or extreme properties?
2. Property Characteristics
    What is the distribution of the number of bedrooms and bathrooms? (plot)
    What is the distribution of property sizes (square feet or square meters)? (plot)
    Are there common patterns in floor plans or building age? (?)
3. Price Analysis
    What is the distribution of property prices?  (plot)
    How does price vary with property size? (Price per square foot/m²)  (common)
    Are there price outliers (luxury or urgent sales)? (box plot)
4. Location Insights
    Which locations or neighborhoods have the highest and lowest average prices? (plot)
    Are there clusters of high-value properties geographically? (maybe)
    How does proximity to landmarks or city centers affect price? (maybe)
5. Correlation and Relationships
    Which features are strongly correlated with property price? (plot)
    How do location, size, and property type interact to affect pricing? (plot)
    Does newer construction or renovation year impact price significantly? (Discussion)
6. Advanced/Optional Questions
    Can we segment the market into clusters (luxury, affordable, mid-market)?
    What is the price distribution per property age group (new vs. old)?
    Is there a relationship between amenities (pool, parking, balcony) and price?

 ##  Problem Statement
The real estate market in Saudi Arabia is complex, and property prices vary a lot due to many factors.

However, missing or inaccurate data makes it hard to know the real value and compare different regions.

## Aim
To identify key factors that influence real estate prices in Saudi Arabia.
 Especially across Riyadh, Dammam, Khobar, and Jeddah.

## Assumptions

Sizes were assumed to be in square meters (m² ).
Prices assumed to be in SAR.
Some properties with 0 kitchens; the kitchen column was assumed as extra kitchens.
Some properties were considered as duplex, but had neither stairs no elevators; these data points were assumed incorrect and eliminated.
Size of the properties as 1 m²  and 95000 m² ; assumed incorrect and eliminated.
